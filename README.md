Spellchecking program

The SpellChecker class checks the spelling of each word in a file against a dictionary file. The dictionary file is turned into a HashMap where the key of each word is equal to the sum of the ASCII values of each character in the word, and each word with the same key is stored in an ArrayList. Each word in the file to spell check is stripped of leading or trailing punctuation, then the word is searched for in the HashMap by computing the wordToCheckâ€™s key and searching for it in the associated ArrayList. If the word is not found in the ArrayList, the findCorrectSpellings method will be called on it, which will check from possible correct spellings by adding each letter a-z or an apostrophe at each position in the word, deleting the letter at each position in the word, and rearranging, adjacent letters in the word. If a correct word (i.e. a word that can be found in the HashMap) is generated, it will be added to an ArrayList of possible correct spellings, which is returned by the findCorrectSpellings method (which is in turn returned by the spellcheck method that calls findCorrectSpellings on misspelled words). Any misspelled word will be returned along with its line number and any possible correct spellings of it.
